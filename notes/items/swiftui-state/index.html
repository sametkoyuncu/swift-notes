How to choose between @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, @StateObject, and @EnvironmentObject, plus navigation/state patterns.
Version Quick Reference

iOS 13 / SwiftUI 1.0: @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, @EnvironmentObject.
iOS 14+: @StateObject, @AppStorage, @SceneStorage, LazyVGrid/HStack, improved NavigationLink.
iOS 16+: NavigationStack / NavigationPath, NavigationSplitView; grid/list improvements.
iOS 17+: observation macro (@Observable) and @Bindable (if available in your toolchain); stick to classic patterns if you target earlier OSes.

Core Property Wrappers

@State: local, view-owned value. Resets when view is re-created; keep it lightweight and value-semantic.
@Binding: derived write-through reference to a @State. Use for child views that mutate parent state.
@ObservedObject: external reference type owned elsewhere. Use when lifetime is managed by a parent.
@StateObject: reference type owned by the view; initialized once per view identity. Use for view-owned models.
@EnvironmentObject: shared object injected via environment. Keep the surface small; avoid making it a grab-bag.

Choosing the Right Wrapper

Start with @State for simple local fields.
Promote to @StateObject when you need an observable reference that must persist across view reloads (e.g., network-backed view model).
Use @ObservedObject when the parent owns the model and passes it down.
Use @Binding for two-way value flows between parent/child (e.g., toggles, text fields).
Reserve @EnvironmentObject for app-wide or feature-wide shared state; provide it high in the tree.

Navigation Patterns (iOS 16+)

Prefer NavigationStack with NavigationPath for programmatic navigation and deep links.

struct Detail: Hashable { let id: UUID }

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var path = NavigationPath()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack(path: $path) {
            List(0..<5) { idx in
                NavigationLink(value: Detail(id: UUID())) { Text("Item \(idx)") }
            }
            .navigationDestination(for: Detail.self) { detail in
                Text("Detail \(detail.id.uuidString)")
            }
        }
    }
}


Side Effects and Async Work

Run lightweight effects in task {} for one-off work when the view appears; use .onChange(of:) for reacting to state changes.
Cancel ongoing tasks when state changes if the work is obsolete (store Task handles in @State or @StateObject).
Keep async logic in view models when it grows; surface results via published properties.

Performance Tips

Minimize state surface: store only what the view needs to render; derive computed values when possible.
Break views into smaller components to reduce diffing scope; pass bindings to avoid redundant observable objects.
Avoid storing large reference types in @State; prefer @StateObject for long-lived references.

Testing and Previews

For previews, inject lightweight mock view models and deterministic data.
For snapshot/UI tests, use stable seeds for randomized content and navigation paths.
