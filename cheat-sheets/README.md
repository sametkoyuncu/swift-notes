## Cheat Sheets

All cheat sheets follow a strict, shared structure.
Each document is designed for quick recall rather than full tutorials.

If you are adding a new cheat sheet:
- Use the template in `cheat-sheets/_template.md`
- Keep it under 1–2 screens
- Focus on "why" and "when", not syntax

### Suggested Topics

The following topics are intentionally chosen to explain
*why Swift behaves the way it does* and *when to choose one abstraction over another*:

- Dispatch in Swift
- Protocol vs Generic
- some vs any (Opaque vs Existential)
- ARC and Memory Management
- Swift Concurrency Mental Model
- Type Erasure
- Copy-on-Write
- Actors and Isolation
